I just want to know if it's cool for me to still ship to my address or if it'll be a problem. I don't want any issues with any of my vendors so I just want to make sure it's cool before I make an order. This ""ParcelPending"" account is set up everything under my name as well.

It's not uncommon for them to run off with the bag.   If you are 100% sure that hasn't happened then i would imagine it has something to do with the crypto postage. No way that many packages were lost, all from different locations going different places. The only real common denominator is you paying the postage with crypto.   If it were me and i was absolutely sure no one on the team was involved i'd burn everything down to the ground and start over.

I would like to know some common methods that people promote not a specific market but vendors on a specific market. The markets cant possibly be just chance and whatever catches whoever's eyes, correct? Additionally, I realize that there are ""Confirmed Market Vendors"" as a tag in this sub.. How is this tag achievable? Archetype seems to be the market with the largest amount of traffic, but how does it compare to other in terms of vendor bond pricing and what are efficient ways of promoting such a vendor on Archetype? Would vending on a smaller market allow for more customers, or is it entirely based on product and supply/demand of your product? Would appreciate any insight."

I've met various people who say that meth is THE productivity drug.  I suggest you ask your doctor for an Amlodipine prescription, it is a prescription vasodilator that you can take on days you take vasoconstrictors (LSD, meth, etc.)"

Even if the cctld operator may not care the registrar / reseller may, and ultimately they have control over the domain.

We also got hit with the phishing report like everybody else but it did not affect the domain, at least not yet.  There is no reliable way of stopping it. If the cctld operator or the registrar/reseller decides to act on a complaint they will and that's that, more so if they receive a legal request (real or not).

If it never shows, and you arent able to verify what happened via tracking (since most vendors will simply reship without giving tracking either way), you must assume it was intercepted, or lost.. but you really need to assume it could have been found, officially or unofficially..  I know this first hand, just because you dont get a knock on your door or a LL after your pack goes *poof* does NOT mean it was NOT seized...feel me? Assume all flagged deliveries are stored, even if the pack makes it through this is very possible they just dont have the P.C. to do anything about it, so it will either get delivered or will disappear.  This is what happened to me, two separate orders months apart, personal use qty did not arrive, one reship arrived fine.. then a few months later, when a third pack was ""undeliverable"" all of a sudden, and returned to sender, the vendor sent a reship, and BOOM, it was seized because the same profiled pack was being delivered in a fresh envelope to my same address the next week.. that was strike three, and I got a charming knock and talk from a local detective and two plainclothes USPIS officers.. only put the pieces together after the fact, they found me worth a visit because of the repeat orders..

Every so often I see packages which normally arrive in 4-5 days take like 10-15 days. USPS is random like that. Until it has been around 3 weeks, it is still somewhat likely the pack will show up.  If you give it another week, I would say it is very likely the package shows up!  Consider also, does the vendor have a solid reputation? If their rep is good, they may have simply forgotten to send the package! Stuff like that does happen, albeit it is uncommon.

I'm in the US but the only vendor I can find is in India. Is it too risky?""  A little more background:  I'm prescribed 20mg of propranolol  (a blood pressure reducer) per day for anxiety. From what I've read, 50mg is the starting dose when prescribed for blood pressure.   I regularly use stimulants so I would like to buy more propranolol or possibly clonidine (which I've also taken in the past) to reduce my blood pressure. (I don't want to use benzos or anything seriously addictive).  The only vendors I can find are overseas, mostly in India.   The Indian vendor that I'm considering, truegenerics, has lots of experiences and good reviews but I would normally never buy internationally.  However, because they aren't scheduled drugs (though they do require a prescription), I am thinking about it.  15+ years ago, I bought unscheduled prescription pharmaceuticals from India on the clearnet without a prescription. They were shipped to me without issue. In fact, I recall paperwork declaring them as pharmaceuticals to customs.   So that experience has me considering making the purchase.   My fear, aside from them being seized and receiving a love letter, is that my home address would then be burned for future domestic purchases.  What do you all think?  Do you have experience with this kind of purchase?  Alternatively, do you know any domestic vendors who could provide blood pressure medication?  Thanks!"
comment,c-7f4aa0428ecc3a5076,c-350bb90bac748560db,,AcidicDr3ams,"My blood pressure always looks great when I visit my doctor (I usually don't dose that day until after my appointment or if I do dose I take a few propranolol right before).  Blood pressure has never been an issue for me but it does go up after I use stimulants of course.   That's normal. What the doctors are looking at is your baseline blood pressure. If its in the good range (<130/80..I think its 130/80) then you should be good. It's normal for stims to increase blood pressure (unless it's getting super high like 150s/90s or some shit). Certain blood pressure meds are actually prescribed for ADHD, that may be one. Even prescribed to help with sleep disturbances caused by ADHD. You should research if yours is one of those and talk with your doctor about it.   If you don't want to do that then just buy them over the clearnet from a reputable overseas pharmacy. It's perfectly legal to purchase non controlled drugs from pharmacies like that as long as you got a precription. It'll take a few weeks to get to you.

I want to conduct my stimulant addiction in a less harmful way but I don't want to alert my doctor that anything has changed.   However, I won't order them internationally if the consensus is that it's not worth the risk.  I'm guessing you're of the opinion that it isn't worth the risk?"

Then, I go ""this sucked, what am I doing?"" and I begin taking it as prescribed and see a benefit. However, it's too late and I run out of my script after a couple of weeks. I crash, get cranky, sleep for a few days, and finally pull myself out of it.  Brother/sister I feel that shit.  I would recommend at least one of these, if not both. But if you are able to I highly recommend going the shroom route. They do something in the brain that helps with compulsive/impulsive dosing and addiction.   Get yourself some shrooms (acid may work, don't know from experience). Set aside 6-8 hours once every 2 weeks and start dosing 0.5g, try more if that dose doesn't help you with this. If you're not experienced with psychedelics/shrooms then I recommend not going above ~2g. It can get...messy. You can even try microdosing more frequently (.250g is the threshold dose and anything less will be considered microdosing, not sure if it would be as beneficial as a larger dose unless you microdose daily, I think). It will help keep those addictive urges away.  Give your medication to someone you trust, a significant other, and let them help you manage it.  If you are NOT experienced with psychedelics/shrooms then here's some shit you should know:  Set & Setting: This is the most important thing before you ever use psychedelics. Never take shrooms or any psychedelic if you are in a shitty mood. Or if your setting/place/home are not calm/doesn't feel safe, or will not be calm/ feel safe at any time during the trip. This also goes for anyone you may be around when you use psychedelics. Be aware that the start of the shroom trip may suck due to any thing that may be bothering you, new & old. You may cry...a lot. If it is like this then know that it will pass, followed by relief.  Do NOT mix stims & psychedelics. You will NOT have any resemblence of a good time. If your significant other is ok with shrooms, and you are comfortable try to eat them when you're SO is around incase you need them. Especially at higher doses. Consider having a bit of liquor or beer around incase the trip gets a too tough/rough for you. Or increases your anxiety too much.  Can't get shrooms? Consider growing them if your living situation allows."

Then, I go ""this sucked, what am I doing?"" and I begin taking it as prescribed and see a benefit. However, it's too late and I run out of my script after a couple of weeks. I crash, get cranky, sleep for a few days, and finally pull myself out of it.  The next month, it's exaactly the same.   SO I thought, maybe if I buy some extra stims to get me through after I run out of my script, I won't have the up and down, bingeing, learning to use it responsibly, and then running out early cycle. I won't be as desperate when I get my script refilled. And I will be able to manage better.  The jury is still out because this is the first month I've done it. We'll see.  BTW, I wish I could smoke weed but every time I do, I go into an obsessive thought spiral about all the things I hate about myself. And I live in a legal state so I've tried many different strains. I haven't smoked or drank alcohol in 6 years. I also don't use nicotine anymore. - just some useless info to explain my substance use. I don't use anything recreationally other than my prescribed methylphenidate and the adderall presses."

comment,c-99fc18d9ef53c0a900,c-d358bb117b5e614bae,,smashedpertaters,"Real quick, I wanted to address how I said I have an 'addiction'.  I think I'm more flippant about calling myself an addict than most people. I've spent a lot of time in AA so I've gotten used to calling myself an addict and alcoholic. (I don't judge anyone else's use because it's an unhealthy mindset, it's none of my business, and only an individual can decide for themselves if they have a problem. And to my amazement, the majority of people seem capable of managing their use).  I think I appear pretty functional at the moment; I have a happy marriage, I'm employed, and I'll finish a graduate degree next month. But when I abuse my meds, I just see it as addict behavior.   And I know that I would be much better at all of those things if I could break this up-and-down cycle.   So, I'll shut the fuck up now. Thanks for reading if you made it this far."

comment,c-41ff01ba1191ea64dc,c-523c6272018fcb4236,,smashedpertaters,"I'm just trying to be cautious. Better safe than sorry I guess.  I'm going to paste what I wrote in another comment to explain my dilemma with asking for an increase in my prescription. Feel free to tell me if I'm being a paranoid dumbass:  Yes, I am prescribed 20mg of propranolol for anxiety but 50mg is the minimum dose for blood pressure.  I do buy stimulants off the darknet and I am also prescribed stimulants.  My blood pressure always looks great when I visit my doctor (I usually don't dose that day until after my appointment or if I do dose I take a few propranolol right before). Blood pressure has never been an issue for me but it does go up after I use stimulants of course.  If my doctor believed that my blood pressure was an issue, they would probably stop prescribing my ADHD meds to me.  I could try telling them 20mg isn't enough for my anxiety but again, they might look at reducing my ADHD med if that were the case.  So yeah, it's a perilous balancing act. I want to conduct my stimulant addiction in a less harmful way but I don't want to alert my doctor that anything has changed."
comment,c-523c6272018fcb4236,2a250b103872c0b8a3bb,,rmrf,"Lol why are you even worried. You aren't going to get a love letter for some blood pressure medicine, its not schedule or controlled like regular drugs are. I don't even think having the medicine without a prescription is more than a misdemeanor but I don't know American laws enough to speak about it. I am confuse why not just go to your doctor and ask for more doses or something saying you are having panic attacks more frequently or even just tell them its not working ??  I am also confused because you say stimulants but it does not sound like you are buying off a dnm? If you are prescribed stimulants then just tell your doctor your concerns? Do you even know you have high blood pressure?"
comment,c-385ca827b8a66398d0,2a250b103872c0b8a3bb,,TW1234,Try asking your domestic prescription pill vendors. I did that for lyrica; asked all the vendors that sold non-opioid/stimulant pills. Then a month later a vendor began stocking it.
post,dee9585e316b7c53e19b,,"Pckg never showed, not on ID, vendor says tracking shows delievered",flockofseafucks,Reddit says go to post office w tracking number and ask them to pull coordinates of when/where package was left. Is that a dumb idea bc its illegal goods. On the other hand if they knew whats in it would it show as delivered? For same reason i'm hesitant to knock around on neighbors doors asking for it. Vendor shows good reviews and fast shipping.

But if you want to use Parcel Pending that should work also and they will most likely not suspect anything due to previous orders etc."

Archetype seems to be the market with the largest amount of traffic, but how does it compare to other in terms of vendor bond pricing and what are efficient ways of promoting such a vendor on Archetype? Would vending on a smaller market allow for more customers, or is it entirely based on product and supply/demand of your product? Would appreciate any insight."

Da only other time I didn't get my pak the vendor got bust -- hope that's not happening now. I really need to order again from another vendor because I'm out a good bit on this one but Idontknow if my drop should be considered burned now or what. All verry disssapointing and stresssful

comment,c-833be0dc464e774f1b,c-ebe7336b8ce808a8bd,,HorkyPorky,"Definitely consideration to give address a nice breather after a pack goes missing. Maybe not necessary, but ultimately if something goes RTS and the return address is bullshit (or if it is legit), somebody is gonna open it. If they realize that it is full of narcotics, police get involved, addy is burned. Could take a month could take several though, that is the confusion.  Def stressful. I would do like 1-2 month pause minimum if pack doesn't arrive though, or obv if something is intercepted you should probably either never use the addy or give it 6mos to a year"
comment,c-ebe7336b8ce808a8bd,c-af6a20558531cb7664,,silvereagle777,"This is good advice. If it never shows, and you arent able to verify what happened via tracking (since most vendors will simply reship without giving tracking either way), you must assume it was intercepted, or lost.. but you really need to assume it could have been found, officially or unofficially..  I know this first hand, just because you dont get a knock on your door or a LL after your pack goes *poof* does NOT mean it was NOT seized...feel me? Assume all flagged deliveries are stored, even if the pack makes it through this is very possible they just dont have the P.C. to do anything about it, so it will either get delivered or will disappear.  This is what happened to me, two separate orders months apart, personal use qty did not arrive, one reship arrived fine.. then a few months later, when a third pack was ""undeliverable"" all of a sudden, and returned to sender, the vendor sent a reship, and BOOM, it was seized because the same profiled pack was being delivered in a fresh envelope to my same address the next week.. that was strike three, and I got a charming knock and talk from a local detective and two plainclothes USPIS officers.. only put the pieces together after the fact, they found me worth a visit because of the repeat orders.. I had no idea but at least one of those ""missing"" packs was definitely seized..LE will let shit through if they think it is worth it.  Stay safe!!"
comment,c-af6a20558531cb7664,13d60ab23ec6acc6bc4f,,HorkyPorky,"Like others said, do not allow the order to finalize if you haven't received the package, extend extend extend.  Message vendor definitely.  Consider this though. Every so often I see packages which normally arrive in 4-5 days take like 10-15 days. USPS is random like that. Until it has been around 3 weeks, it is still somewhat likely the pack will show up.  If you give it another week, I would say it is very likely the package shows up!  Consider also, does the vendor have a solid reputation? If their rep is good, they may have simply forgotten to send the package! Stuff like that does happen, albeit it is uncommon. Vendor will be able to help more than anyone here, so shoot em a message!"
post,2a250b103872c0b8a3bb,,I want to buy blood pressure medication (non-scheduled) to counteract some of the negative effects of stimulant use. I'm in the US but the only vendor,smashedpertaters,"*EDIT because the title was cut off:  ""I want to buy blood pressure medication (non-scheduled) to counteract some of the negative effects of stimulant use. I'm in the US but the only vendor I can find is in India. Is it too risky?""  A little more background:  I'm prescribed 20mg of propranolol  (a blood pressure reducer) per day for anxiety. From what I've read, 50mg is the starting dose when prescribed for blood pressure.   I regularly use stimulants so I would like to buy more propranolol or possibly clonidine (which I've also taken in the past) to reduce my blood pressure. (I don't want to use benzos or anything seriously addictive).  The only vendors I can find are overseas, mostly in India.   The Indian vendor that I'm considering, truegenerics, has lots of experiences and good reviews but I would normally never buy internationally.  However, because they aren't scheduled drugs (though they do require a prescription), I am thinking about it.  15+ years ago, I bought unscheduled prescription pharmaceuticals from India on the clearnet without a prescription. They were shipped to me without issue. In fact, I recall paperwork declaring them as pharmaceuticals to customs.   So that experience has me considering making the purchase.   My fear, aside from them being seized and receiving a love letter, is that my home address would then be burned for future domestic purchases.  What do you all think?  Do you have experience with this kind of purchase?  Alternatively, do you know any domestic vendors who could provide blood pressure medication?  Thanks!"
comment,c-7f4aa0428ecc3a5076,c-350bb90bac748560db,,AcidicDr3ams,"My blood pressure always looks great when I visit my doctor (I usually don't dose that day until after my appointment or if I do dose I take a few propranolol right before).  Blood pressure has never been an issue for me but it does go up after I use stimulants of course.   That's normal. What the doctors are looking at is your baseline blood pressure. If its in the good range (<130/80..I think its 130/80) then you should be good. It's normal for stims to increase blood pressure (unless it's getting super high like 150s/90s or some shit). Certain blood pressure meds are actually prescribed for ADHD, that may be one. Even prescribed to help with sleep disturbances caused by ADHD. You should research if yours is one of those and talk with your doctor about it.   If you don't want to do that then just buy them over the clearnet from a reputable overseas pharmacy. It's perfectly legal to purchase non controlled drugs from pharmacies like that as long as you got a precription. It'll take a few weeks to get to you. Look on reddit for reputable overseas pharmacies you can order from. You will need a checking account for ACH, for quickest proccessing."
comment,c-fae2c1dbe13b8fc6c4,c-350bb90bac748560db,,AcidicDr3ams,"You could look up your med and see if its precribed for ADHD sleep disturbances or insomnia off label. If you can't find anything then look for any studies relating to that on nih.gov (google that shit). Then speak with your doctor about having sleep issues. Never that you can't get to sleep, just that you can't stay asleep. So you can get to sleep just fine but you've been waking up during the night and would like to increase your dose to try some at night to see if it helps. Then go from there."
comment,c-350bb90bac748560db,c-57fed3734bb8611b25,,smashedpertaters,"True, like I said I already am prescribed 20mg of propranolol for anxiety but 50mg is the minimum dose for blood pressure.  Here is my issue: I am also prescribed stimulant meds for ADHD, which I supplement with more stimulants from the darknet.   My blood pressure always looks great when I visit my doctor (I usually don't dose that day until after my appointment or if I do dose I take a few propranolol right before).   Blood pressure has never been an issue for me but it does go up after I use stimulants of course.  If my doctor believed that my blood pressure was an issue, they would probably stop prescribing my ADHD meds to me.   I could try telling them 20mg isn't enough for my anxiety but again, they might look at reducing my ADHD med if that were the case.   So yeah, it's a perilous balancing act. I want to conduct my stimulant addiction in a less harmful way but I don't want to alert my doctor that anything has changed.   However, I won't order them internationally if the consensus is that it's not worth the risk.  I'm guessing you're of the opinion that it isn't worth the risk?"

Then, I go ""this sucked, what am I doing?"" and I begin taking it as prescribed and see a benefit. However, it's too late and I run out of my script after a couple of weeks. I crash, get cranky, sleep for a few days, and finally pull myself out of it.  Brother/sister I feel that shit.  I would recommend at least one of these, if not both. But if you are able to I highly recommend going the shroom route. They do something in the brain that helps with compulsive/impulsive dosing and addiction.   Get yourself some shrooms (acid may work, don't know from experience). Set aside 6-8 hours once every 2 weeks and start dosing 0.5g, try more if that dose doesn't help you with this. If you're not experienced with psychedelics/shrooms then I recommend not going above ~2g. It can get...messy. You can even try microdosing more frequently (.250g is the threshold dose and anything less will be considered microdosing, not sure if it would be as beneficial as a larger dose unless you microdose daily, I think). It will help keep those addictive urges away.  Give your medication to someone you trust, a significant other, and let them help you manage it.  If you are NOT experienced with psychedelics/shrooms then here's some shit you should know:  Set & Setting: This is the most important thing before you ever use psychedelics. Never take shrooms or any psychedelic if you are in a shitty mood. Or if your setting/place/home are not calm/doesn't feel safe, or will not be calm/ feel safe at any time during the trip. This also goes for anyone you may be around when you use psychedelics. Be aware that the start of the shroom trip may suck due to any thing that may be bothering you, new & old. You may cry...a lot. If it is like this then know that it will pass, followed by relief.  Do NOT mix stims & psychedelics. You will NOT have any resemblence of a good time. If your significant other is ok with shrooms, and you are comfortable try to eat them when you're SO is around incase you need them. Especially at higher doses. Consider having a bit of liquor or beer around incase the trip gets a too tough/rough for you. Or increases your anxiety too much.  Can't get shrooms? Consider growing them if your living situation allows."
comment,c-062eaefcb41bce4243,c-d358bb117b5e614bae,,smashedpertaters,"I'm prescribed methylphenidate (generic Concerta, 72mg per day).  I just started purchasing pressed Adderall (a combination of dextroamphetamine and methamphetamine according to the seller).  I had a 6 month downward spiral of meth addiction about 10 years ago but I haven't gone back to pure crystal.  If you care, my logic for ordering the pressed addies is probably some ridiculous addict justification. But here is my thought process:  Every month, I get my prescription refilled and it's like Christmas. I go ham and barely sleep for 3 or 4 days. Then, I go ""this sucked, what am I doing?"" and I begin taking it as prescribed and see a benefit. However, it's too late and I run out of my script after a couple of weeks. I crash, get cranky, sleep for a few days, and finally pull myself out of it.  The next month, it's exaactly the same.   SO I thought, maybe if I buy some extra stims to get me through after I run out of my script, I won't have the up and down, bingeing, learning to use it responsibly, and then running out early cycle. I won't be as desperate when I get my script refilled. And I will be able to manage better.  The jury is still out because this is the first month I've done it. We'll see.  BTW, I wish I could smoke weed but every time I do, I go into an obsessive thought spiral about all the things I hate about myself. And I live in a legal state so I've tried many different strains. I haven't smoked or drank alcohol in 6 years. I also don't use nicotine anymore. - just some useless info to explain my substance use. I don't use anything recreationally other than my prescribed methylphenidate and the adderall presses."

I've spent a lot of time in AA so I've gotten used to calling myself an addict and alcoholic. (I don't judge anyone else's use because it's an unhealthy mindset, it's none of my business, and only an individual can decide for themselves if they have a problem. And to my amazement, the majority of people seem capable of managing their use).  I think I appear pretty functional at the moment; I have a happy marriage, I'm employed, and I'll finish a graduate degree next month.

You aren't going to get a love letter for some blood pressure medicine, its not schedule or controlled like regular drugs are. I don't even think having the medicine without a prescription is more than a misdemeanor but I don't know American laws enough to speak about it. I am confuse why not just go to your doctor and ask for more doses or something saying you are having panic attacks more frequently or even just tell them its not working ??  I am also confused because you say stimulants but it does not sound like you are buying off a dnm? If you are prescribed stimulants then just tell your doctor your concerns? Do you even know you have high blood pressure?"
