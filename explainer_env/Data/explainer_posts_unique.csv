post,1ac65a9e4188f69f8b17,,how risky is getting packages sent to the USA from other countries?,pandadaddy,Curious because most speed vendors are eu base or in Germany and im in america.  What's the best way to go about it?

comment,c-1fec40945d6cacde9c,1ac65a9e4188f69f8b17,,witch,"Use the handful of speed vendors in the US. If you order international, I would bet anything that you'll receive a love letter from US Customs and no speed. I understand the price difference makes it tempting. Don't fall for it. I would recommend finding another stimulant, stick to the domestic speed vendors, or find a way to get real Amphetamine (adderall) for cheaper than it tends to be on the markets (most real domestic pharma stuff is overpriced as fuck online, you're better off finding someone local who knows the right people if you can. some people will pay $15 for a single 30mg IR tablet, if I cared to I could get full month's script for 50 or so. Just depends, could be anyone.)"

User will tell you what you need to know on those reviews. Take care of fake reviews (""my order was fast"" when average time is more than a week) Good luck!"

Don't put all your drugs in one basket.   $1500 may or may not buy you much depending on your taste in substances. If ordering various drugs, unless you find a vendor that carries everything you want, you may be looking at more than 1 pack anyway to get all the things you're looking for.   A good rule to shop by is to only have 1 pack in the mail stream at a time. Once you receive it, everything is good, nothing out of the ordinary, then order the next one.   Additionally, it doesn't hurt to have other legitimate items on the way at the same time as your pack. Ordering a handful of Amazon packages around the same time gives your pack something to blend in with, especially useful if you're ordering regularly."

USPS shows address as invalid despite it being same the buyer gave. Buyer said his address may be burnt due to a prior order. Package attempted to return to sender (fake address). Package then was sent to GA where item's that are considered lost/underliverable goto. Now package is being sent back to the county it was sent from. Any tips? Should I clean house and go on vacation mode for some time? What should I do? Check tracking today, shows as moving through system in city near location it was sent from. (Not checking tracking anymore, every time tracking was checked was via a vpn or proxy). County it was re-sent too has fingerprints in the system from a decade ago.  Order was nothing big, small $60-$70 order package of some benzo's.  This has me worried as it was already attempted to be resent to sender and failed, went to GA where packages that are lost/etc are opened/auctioned but is now back in my county. What should I do?"

post,5dd1df10f43cc246ece8,,I have a question..,bkstreetathlet3,"Let's say theoretically here, that you go onto a market, and while browsing you come across a listing from a 'red flag' country with customs that looks both appealing and cheap, but have a appallingly low chance of making it through customs at the destination country.  I browse through their feedback and it seems OK, more positive than negative but there are some negative feedback there that I can’t ignore, things like my pack never arrived, communication stopped etc that do no instill confidence in me in the slightest.   Against my better judgment, after staring at the photos of the listings and I had an idea in my head that I could use the listing for and turn them into something I wanted even more greatly. So I decided to do a test order, just a small one. Encrypted my details and sent it off.  Being from the other side of the world I kind of did the old ‘click and forget’ and went about my life, hoping for a lovely surprise one day that my package had arrived against all odds.  Well, turns out, I’m a fuckwit. Of course nothing came, they took my $17AUD and ran for the hills. And I’m not talking a brisk jog for the hills, I imagine these were running that fast in their leather strapped sandles the friction created smoke so thick and acrid the dude running last ended up hanging out the back end of a goat attached by his genitalia.  Now I am getting a bit off topic here, moral of the story is I was AFK (silly) and missed the auto finalize so this vendor got their coins without sending the pack IMO. So I sent them a message and explained my situation. To which they said, just keep waiting, it’ll show up. (Mind you, it had been 5 weeks by this stage).   I eventually got annoyed, sent them a message saying don’t worry about it, you’re clearly a scammer and I will just post my findings on every forum that I am on and let everyone know that you selectively scam your clients. I left bad feedback warning other customers to tread lightly with this vendor.  I get a message from them saying please send your XMR wallet and we will refund you your money, (something insignificant ~ 25USD). I thought this was a nice tough after all of the running and mucking around that had already been done with this order, I had gotten over it and really just wanted to hear nothing more of it.  The vendor then goes: ‘ I will refund you your money, and you will change your feedback to 5 stars’.  Straight away that didn’t sit well with me, just because I get my $~20 back doesn’t make this experience anywhere near 5 stars. Without follow up I wouldn’t have even gotten that. So I thought that was misleading, so I created a ticket and asked a mod, I said he’s offering to pay me here to change reviews to untruthful ones, because his customer service stealth and comms are all under 5.  Mods said there’s nothing wrong with that. Maybe I’m missing something here but is that right? I just seem to think it’s going to lead to a shit load of vendors with reviews that aren’t really genuine and can be very misleading for you and I when we go to make an order.  Maybe I’m just overthinking this, it has been a very big week.   What do you think?  Should vendors be able to pay customers to put misleading information up as reviews in return for coin/product?  B"

I too enjoy writing about experiences in a way others will find interesting and not leaving me on the edge of my seat expecting to eventually get to a conclusion. i read on and on. its clear you’re a customer and not a potential biased opinion stalling for time so i stay on your thread. You really should have offered them the chance to send you a refund in return for a review that explains the experience you had but also the positive resolution.   I like the part you divulged on basically begging for something to instil confidence in your purchase, it really resonates. My first time i spent hours finding the best combination of drugs to buy before finding at checkout there was a minimum order quantity MOQ. for all i know it was a market-vendor collaboration scam where they have a database for all the custom’s love-letters so therefore buying only a small quantity would surely undermine scanning technology, a small time guy like me doesnt want to buy a minimum of ten seeds and per variety 4 seeds (so a minimum of 12, if you do the math which they obviously haven’t). Im really hoping my deposit goes through of $40, its been 12 hours unconfirmed at 0.00003btc gas on btc network.   At the end of the day, some postage is really expensive and maybe the amount you order turned out to be mostly postage fees for the vendor with little profit."

post,ba8587094e96c2874ccf,,ParcelPending?,m4dness,"I recently moved to a new apartment and instead of packages getting delivered to my doorstep, it gets delivered to this third party company called ""ParcelPending"" which basically made me make an account with them that will leave my packages in this locker parcel that is next to the leasing office. I also have a mailbox but you know some packages get dropped at the door or in my case this ""parcelpending"" locker that I have. I just want to know if it's cool for me to still ship to my address or if it'll be a problem. I don't want any issues with any of my vendors so I just want to make sure it's cool before I make an order. This ""ParcelPending"" account is set up everything under my name as well. They usually email me when a package has arrived with a code to unlock the locker. Thank yall for helping."

comment,c-1b1de9a684cc868a86,ba8587094e96c2874ccf,,Kainara,"Well If your asking if you should be shipping to your address then it is less likely for any issues to arise from shipping directly to your residence (Unless you have a ""Drop"" that's properly setup of course.) But if you want to use Parcel Pending that should work also and they will most likely not suspect anything due to previous orders etc."

comment,c-b1084ae63840a91aac,ba8587094e96c2874ccf,,Beelzebub,"The post office is unlikely to use a third party to deliver your mail. You should check that I'm right.   Vendors don't generally use transport companies. You need to check that, too.   If it fits in your letterbox, the postman will leave it there. If it's too big for that, I doubt the postman would leave it in a publicly accessible place in a block of units. You would probably need to pick it up at the Post Office.      I'm an Aussie. What I've told you works here. You need to check the information if you live in the US."
post,bb60ac95f16bac956c88,,whole drop's worth of packs never scanned at all. (also never arrived) USA,packrattt,"Veteran vendor here.  have various hubs with shipping staff around the country(USA)  use crypto postage options.  spread out drops in various cities around various states.  had a drop two weeks ago of about 10 flat rate packs.  never scanned. never arrived. never heard a word. .  Been in this scene for many years.  never seen something not even get an intake scan that was seized.   if it was an investigation. I dont see them handling it like that... just disappearing the whole drop. maybe opening a few and checking what's in it. then shipping them out(contents not that bad by dnm standards)  anyone else have this happen?   stolen?  seized?"

comment,c-99b1a0bb98c8c0d810,c-c7b17c02fea67b6e64,,Tre,"Ah, it still doesn't look good. Best case scenario your runner robbed you which, it happens. Worst LE is sitting on that drop. There is also a chance the carrier lost the entire drop but that's a reach and personally it would be hard for me to convince myself of that.   If you've ever read vendor arrest, it almost always involves LE sitting on a drop and snatching up all the packages, so personally that's what i would be most concerned with."

comment,c-4c7629c47c20833256,bb60ac95f16bac956c88,,Tre,"How solid is your team? Are any addicts or have a past history of using ? It's not uncommon for them to run off with the bag.   If you are 100% sure that hasn't happened then i would imagine it has something to do with the crypto postage. No way that many packages were lost, all from different locations going different places. The only real common denominator is you paying the postage with crypto.   If it were me and i was absolutely sure no one on the team was involved i'd burn everything down to the ground and start over. New shop, vendor name, drops & new shipping methods (no crypto postage postage)."

In that time, I've received well over 100 parcels."
comment,c-8c03cc2f4f4682ad2b,bb60ac95f16bac956c88,,SlovenianPlugInUSA,"'use crypto postage options.'  Risky  'anyone else have this happen?'  Happened. Shipping team busted <1yr after. Packages not mentioned in documents on PACER. Unsure if seized. Likely shipping team member stealing."
