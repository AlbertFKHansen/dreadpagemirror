http://kaizushih5iec2mxohpvbt5uaapqdnbluaasa2cmsrrjtwrbx46cnaid.onion,The Blue Pony,"I used to host onion sites, now retired.      Retired At KLOS (Kaizushi's Little Onion Server) I provided a shared Linux system via Tor onion services for money. I started doing this because the space had been vacated by some old friends of mine, and because I was confident that such a system could be practical and secure. While I did do quite a bit to keep the system secure myself, it is important to note that my confidence stems from the work in the Linux, open source, and Gentoo community. I also offered a range of services for users of KLOS as a Linux system, in deploying PHP web applications for their benefit. I would host vendor stores, forums, and such for quite a while. I also hosted some other systems to provide email service, XMPP, and an XMR node. I did have plans to do even more in the future. However, my confidence waned. While I am sure that now just as before that just as much quality work is being done in the open source community, I have come to fear that many governments and other powerful institutions are looking to subvert that. When I started doing this it was my view that such people were stupid, and anyone smart would be a positive and constructive part of the process. I and many others have seen the impotent requests of tyrants to provide backdoors and water down systems. One can be pretty confident that these sorts of people are not going to achieve much. These impotent and foolish people do have money and large scale resources and I have come to fear that they can get the results they want, and are using artifical intelligence to develop, test, and stockpile exploits on our otherwise secure systems. I had issues in the middle of 2024 where protections in the kernel against RCE exploits were triggered multiple times, in a number of different ways, resulting in kernel panics. I believe that they were attempting to get remote code execution, and were close to getting it. Yet, months went past and these crashes happened about five times. It is worth noting that these exploits were probably initiated from shell accounts because of the level of access I provide to customers. While pretty much nobody provides SSH access widely like I would, really with other sites and major players on the darknet it will just take the use of a multitude more exploits for these adversaries to get what they want. Dread, and certain markets have been operating without issue for quite some time. I think actually that some records have been set in the time some of the biggest players here on the DN have been running. It is possible that certain adversaries are leaving them alone as a form of harm reduction, selectively enforcing the law because they prefer the order and rules that Dread and the current popular markets are running by. However, there are many other countries and all of these will be using AI to cause trouble. I do think that trouble is going to come, that over the course of this year there will come a number of takedowns on popular DN sites. Because of these issues I am taking a backseat role from here, and making my presence minimal. While I have a pretty pessimistic outlook in the near term, I do think that in the long run that the battle is ours to win. I simply want to remain until a day comes again that I am confident that I can fight, confident that open source works and that the battle is to be won again.   here is my my current gpg key and i signed it with all my previous keys  donate...  8951mmfNw3z43Sqs9MYTU9RmoJute2jZ9HgZTajxYudj73DN77GJGPLVoWYUU65NrbRS6EGejmjyTAFhUzmA2sTS7wm9Gzz  castle one"

Whonix VPNs                 Hidden IP address (basic)                               Your                 IP address                 acts as a global unique identifier which is linked to your real identity.                 Any website or server you are connecting to knows your IP address.                 Most Internet Service Providers (ISPs) keep a log of IP addresses assigned to you and when                 you used them. The IP address reveals your approximate physical location to any destination                 you connect to.                                    Hidden Identity                               Even if your IP is hidden trackers can use ""Fingerprinting"" techniques to identify you.                                  Hiding your identity is harder than just hiding your IP!                                  Whonix                 protects                 from                 browser fingerprinting,                 and                 website traffic fingerprinting.                                    No Logging                               Whonix cannot log user IP addresses or activity. This is due to a                 fundamental architecture design                 decision to keep maximum user privacy.                                  Most VPNs have a policy of not storing any user data. But if they were forced to do so they could                   start storing user data easily.                                        Leak Shield                               Even if a connection is tunneled it can be hijacked inside the browser. One leaky connection                 already compromises the user's anonymity.                 Whonix has a watertight leak shield.                  Some VPN providers also have a fail-closed mechanism however the quality varies very much and fails                 against malware.                                    Server Relays avg.                               The servers used for tunneling MUST NOT know the user. This is only possible if there are                  multiple  and                  independent servers                  as relays on a                                    strict need-to-know basis                                  and                 onion-layered encryption.                                  Some VPN providers provide double VPN but it’s still the same provider and lacks distributed                 trust by design.                               3                         1                            Virus / Malware Protection                               A                                    malware (virus)                                  free system                                    is crucial                                  because a lot malware is stealing the user's data and identity.                 Whonix is based on Kicksecure, a hardened, well documented Linux so the user is already safer.                                  Some VPN subscriptions contain anti-malware scanners but                                    their capability is limited                 .

Cloaking your IP address is difficult because the Internet is not designed for     privacy. Whonix solves this problem by forcing all connections through            multiple anonymity servers          with            its Dual-VM Architecture     .         DNS leaks are impossible with Whonix.     And even malware with root privileges cannot discover the user's real IP address.     Whonix was thoroughly leak tested through     corridor     (Tor traffic whitelisting gateway) and other     leak tests.            Internet tracking companies            don't even need to know your IP address          to be able to identify you. They use so-called     Browser Fingerprinting     which can track you even better than an IP address.         Even your     personal typing style     or     your individual computer time     can give away your identity.            Every website has a unique fingerprint          so your Internet history is not even safe with a VPN.            Our website offers an onion service option, enhancing user anonymity     through alternative end-to-end encryption that avoids dependence on flawed TLS certificate authorities     flawed TLS certificate authorities     and the mainstream Domain Name System (DNS).            Whonix utilizes Tor, the best anonymity network,     which provides an open and distributed relay network to defend against     network surveillance.         Multiple server hops. Privacy by design. Need to know architecture. Onion-layered encryption.     Unlike Virtual Private Networks (VPN), Tor provides anonymity by design and removes trust from the equation.            Decades of research by the security community lead to many best practices. Whonix is based on     Kicksecure     which is a security-hardened Linux distribution     that implements the consensus of these reasonable security measures.        Your typing style     can be used to track you. To prevent this, Whonix comes with     kloak     (a keystroke anonymizer) installed by default             Distinct applications are routed through different paths in the     Tor network. This is called     Stream Isolation.        Timing-based fingerprinting attacks     on Whonix users are mitigated through     Boot Clock Randomization     and secure network time synchronization via     sdwdate     (Secure Distributed Web Date).            Mouse tracking allows websites to collect detailed behavioral data—such as click patterns     and cursor paths—that can be analyzed with AI to identify users across sessions and even across different networks.     Whonix includes tools like Kloak and Qubes Event Buffering     to disrupt these tracking methods by adding subtle randomness to user input.            Not even WE know.

The buyerâs DNM bible aims to be a complete guide that covers all steps that users have to take in order to buy securely from darknetmarkets. It orientates itself on OpSec best practices and, if exactly followed, will greatly minimize the risk of you getting caught. There never will be 100% security, but with the help of the buyerâs DNM bible you can make it extremely hard and not worthwhile for law enforcement to catch you. If you are a complete new user and have heard nothing or close to nothing about topic like Tails, Monero and PGP, you will need several hours to go through this guide and follow the instructions. In fact you will probably not be able to buy from darknetmarkets tomorrow or the day after tomorrow. It takes time to get the secure setup, which is described in the DNM bible, working. Once you finished the initial setup it will be pretty easy though. For future orders you just have to repeat the same steps for ordering on the secure setup that you already have. However buying from DNMs is not for everyone. If you have little computer experience and are not willing to invest much time, then you should stick to real life sources and stay away from the DNMs. They will only get you into big legal trouble if you do not use them correctly. If you are willing to learn and invest some time, then please read and follow every single step of the guide. If you run into problems please check if the DNM bible or the sidebar of /d/DarknetMarketsNoobs  already has that issue covered. If not feel free to make a post on this subdread with a detailed description of your issues. Some parts of this guide have gifs added to them which show how to do some of the steps. However these are just as additional information because software often changes and these gifs can quickly become outdated. Please read the guide first and the resources that are linked before blindly doing what is shown in the gif. If you get stuck somewhere you can watch the gifs which may clear things up for you. Happy reading and stay safe. Any requests or changes you can message me on Dread Shakybeats    Interesting in reading the DNM bible offline? Make sure you read our new offline chapter!.

The first parameter in a files URL is the decryption key. The server is configured to not log the key. Files are temporarily stored unencrypted on the server when accessed.                  It would be trivial for me or a host to start logging decryption keys.
