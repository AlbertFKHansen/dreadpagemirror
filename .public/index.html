    <!-- Introduction -->
    <section>
        <h2>Introduction</h2>
        <div class="introduction">
            <p>The dark web operates differently from the surface web we use daily, with special technology that keeps users and websites anonymous. Unlike regular websites that appear in Google searches, dark web sites can only be found through scraping known sites for new onion addresses or word-of-mouth. This creates a need for central meeting places like <strong>Dread</strong> (a play on "Dark Reddit"), where users gather to share information.</p>
            
            <div class="row">
                <div class="column">
                    <img src="dread.png" alt="dread" style="width:100%; border: 1px solid #ddd;">
                    <p style="text-align: center; font-style: italic;">Screenshot of Dread's biggest subforums</p>
                </div>
                <div class="column">
                    <img src="dnm.png" alt="dnm" style="width:100%; border: 1px solid #ddd;">
                    <p style="text-align: center; font-style: italic;">Screenshot of the DarkNetMarkets subdread's front page</p>
                </div>
            </div>
            
            <h3>Marketplaces on the Dark Web</h3>
            <p>Dark web marketplaces function differently than normal e-commerce sites. They often act as middlemen between buyers and vendors:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Marketplaces</strong> provide the platform (like eBay) but often don't sell products themselves</li>
                <li><strong>Vendors</strong> are the actual sellers who list their products on these platforms</li>
                <li><strong>Transactions</strong> use cryptocurrency and focus on anonymity</li>
                <li><strong>Sites</strong> frequently disappear due to law enforcement actions or scams</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>Our Research Approach</h3>
            <p>We scraped and analyzed 7 years of conversations from the subdread (a subforum on Dread) DarkNetMarkets, one of the most active communities discussing illicit marketplaces, to understand:</p>
            <div class="row">
                <div class="column">
                    <ul>
                        <li>Who the most influential users are</li>
                        <li>Which marketplaces dominate discussions</li>
                        <li>How communities form around different topics</li>
                    </ul>
                </div>
                <div class="column">
                    <ul>
                        <li>What language patterns reveal about user behavior</li>
                        <li>How discussions change after marketplace takedowns</li>
                        <li>The relationship between the most influential users and markets</li>
                    </ul>
                </div>
            </div>

            <div class="insight-box">
                <h4>Why This Matters</h4>
                <p>The dark web remains fragmented and poorly understood by researchers. Gaining insight of these marketplace discussions helps reveal how underground economies operate, how communities adapt to takedowns, and what products dominate these hidden markets.</p>

    <section id="dataset-overview">
        <h2>Dataset Overview</h2>
        <p>Our dataset captures conversations from DarkNetMarkets, where users discuss dark web marketplaces, share experiences, and warn about scams. Collected over three days in April 2025, it contains posts dating back to the forum's creation in 2018.</p>
        
        <div class="insight-box">
            <h4>Key Numbers</h4>
            <p><strong>197,516</strong> total posts and comments from <strong>~30,000</strong> unique active users discussing <strong>90+</strong> different marketplaces</p>

        <h3>What's in the Data?</h3>
        <p>The dataset includes every post and comment from the DarkNetMarkets subforum, carefully collected using a custom-built web scraper. To avoid detection and bans by the forum’s anti-bot measures, we had to slow down scraping when flagged — adding to the challenge.</p>
        
        <div class="metric-card">

    <!-- Content Analysis Section -->
    <section id="content-analysis">
        <h2>Content Analysis</h2>
        <p>By analyzing the language used in posts, we can identify key topics, influential users, and popular marketplaces. We used TF-IDF (a method that identifies important words by their frequency in individual posts compared to their overall frequency) to uncover these patterns.</p>

            <p>Discussions focus heavily on practical marketplace concerns: orders, vendors, shipping, and payments (especially cryptocurrency like Bitcoin and Monero). Surprisingly little discussion of specific illegal products.</p>
        </div>
        
        <h3>The Most Influential Users</h3>
            <p>The top nine users by number of interactions are:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>samwhiskey</strong> (2,562 interactions): Longtime moderator of the subdread</li>
                <li><strong>HugBunter</strong> (2,208 interactions): Founder of Dread, often focuses on technical issues</li>
                <li><strong>dontlaugh</strong> (1,332 interactions): Current moderator enforcing forum rules</li>
                <li><strong>Witchman05</strong> (1,210 interactions): Founder of the Versus marketplace, has gone dark the last couple of years</li>
                <li><strong>Shakybeats</strong> (1,077 interactions): Global moderator of Dread</li>
                <li><strong>wombat2combat</strong> (740 interactions): Former moderator, has not been active for years</li>
                <li><strong>killswitch</strong> (666 interactions): Previously moderated the Xanax subdread</li>
                <li><strong>Paris</strong> (630 interactions): Dread co-founder</li>
                <li><strong>MJA20WithA3</strong> (599 interactions): Just an active community-member, has not been active for years</li>
            </ul>
            <p> Unsurprisingly, multiple of the top users are moderators or founders of Dread. They have a significant impact on the community, with their posts and comments often setting the tone for discussions. 
                Together, these top users account for nearly 7% of all interactions while representing just 0.03% of users.</p>

    <p>Samwhiskey's wordcloud stands out with terms like "world", "national", and "holiday".

This unique posting pattern makes these terms statistically prominent despite being unrelated to marketplace discussions.</p>

        <p>While established figures like moderators samwhiskey (who is evidently no longer posting a daily "its national day of..." sadface ) and dontlaugh, along with Dread founder HugBunter, continue to play central roles, there are also new influential voices. Archetyp staff member newbieforever2018 has been an active member since the subdread's creation seven years ago, and are now promoting Archetyp while engaging in community discussions. Other active members like Beelzebub, who is known in the community for their ASCII art that appears as unreadable rectangles in their wordcloud, and jedi_knight_errant, are former or current moderators of other subdreads.</p>

        <p>Since the popular marketplaces found in the earlier network: Dream, Empire, and White House Market, have all been seized by law enforcement, current discussions focus on new and currently-running platforms like Archetyp and Abacus, along with the enduring DNM Bible guide. Archetyp's prominence is particularly interested given its staff's active forum participation. It is evident that marketplaces and vendors uses the subdread to promote their products.</p>

                    The global clustering coefficent is much larger than the density of the network. This indicates a strong local clustering, meaning that users are likely to form tightly-knit groups, even if the overall network is sparse. The average shortest path length being small, and the local clustering coefficient being high, implies that the network is small-world, typical of social networks.

        <h3>What Communities Talk About</h3>
        <p>Each community develops its own discussion patterns. Contrary to our expectations (when we began this project and had very limited knowledge of the dark web and its marketplaces), communities seem to form around preferred marketplaces rather than product types. 
            However, since learning that big marketplaces seldom are specialized in certain illicit products, but simply middlemen, this aligns. They therefore often have a wide variety of products, mostly drugs, cybercrime and counterfeit goods.
            Below are the most common words (weighted by TF-IDF) for the nine biggest communities by number of users.</p>

    <div class="community-box">
        <h3>Community 1 (5,259 users)</h3>
        <p>The largest identified community serves as the general discussion hub of the subdread, containing both moderators like /u/samwhiskey and /u/dontlaugh as well as the most active users. Characterized by terms like "package," "orders," and "mail," this group primarily deals with practical marketplace issues - users troubleshooting delivery problems, discussing seized shipments, and exchanging advice about drug purchases.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="community-box">
        <h3>Community 41 (4,556 users)</h3>
        <p>The second-largest community focuses on technical aspects of dark web transactions, with frequent mentions of PGP encryption ("pgp"), cryptocurrency wallets ("wallet", "xmr" for Monero), and account security, along with preferred marketplaces AlphaBay and Versus.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="community-box combined">
        <h3>Other Notable Communities</h3>
        <p>Many of the communities formed around specific preferred marketplaces, indicating customer loyalty. Community 4 seemed to be the Empire marketplace hub, while Community 6 the Dream market hub, and Community 37 primarily engaged with Bohemia market.</p>
        
        <p>Interestingly, one of the smaller but distinctive communities (Community 7 with just 192 members) stands out for its positive social atmosphere - dominated by words like "friend" and "friends" - despite their association with the now-defunct Monopoly marketplace (seized in 2023).</p>

    <!-- Major Communities (Individual Boxes) -->
    <div class="community-box">
        <h3>Community 7 (1,884 users)</h3>
        <p>The largest community primarily mentions now-seized markets <strong>Dream</strong> and <strong>WSM</strong> (Wall Street Market). These marketplaces were once some of the most popular, selling everything from drugs, to counterfeit goods and stolen data. When they closed within a month of eachother in 2019, they left a significant gap in the market. Many users discussed where to migrate, and the marketplaces are therefore often mentioned together. WSM performed a so-called <a href="glossary.html#exit-scam">exit scam</a>, which is likely the reason for clear use of "scam"

    <div class="community-box">
        <h3>Community 13 (1,196 users)</h3>
        <p>Formed around <strong>Empire Market</strong>, which became the primary migration destination after Dream/WSM collapsed before itself exit scamming in 2020.</p>

    <div class="community-box">
        <h3>Community 9 (790 users)</h3>
        <p>Notably, Community 9 - which includes /u/samwhiskey - discusses some of the biggest currently active platforms, <strong>Archetyp</strong> and <strong>Abacus Market</strong>. Archetyp only sells drugs, and has a good reputation in the subdread, whereas Abacus, sells a variety of illicit goods. The term "world" in the community's wordcloud, likely refers to <strong>World Market</strong>, a now-bunked marketplace, whose owners are allegedly also behind Abacus. They have a terrible reputation, as they pulled an exit scam with the World Market and then <a href="glossary.html#exit-scam">DDoS'ed</a> Dread.

Community 6, prefers <strong>Bohemia </strong>, another big marketplace, that primarily sold drugs and cannabis running in 2021-2023. </p>

        <p>The tech-focused Community 10 stands apart. Here moderators dontlaugh and shakybeats participate in discussions about security tools like the <strong>DNM bible</strong>, <strong>Whonix</strong>, <strong>Tails</strong>, and <strong>Tor</strong> rather than specific marketplaces. </p>
        
        <p>Community 5 orients cryptocurrency marketplaces, <strong>Cryptonia</strong> and <strong>Apollon</strong>, both of whom has shutdown.</p>

        <p>The ninth biggest community's most discussed website is <strong>dark.fails</strong>, which is not actually a marketplace, but an onion-site tracker.</p>
